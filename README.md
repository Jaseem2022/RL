Note : Some packages have deprecated and wont work correctly. Especially the render() function.

PS : Please note that i didnt come up with this on my own.It was a code along video posted by youtuber Nicholas Renotte.
    But it was a great experience and great stepping stone into my first attempt at RL algorithms.

This project uses PPO algorithm a popular Reinforcement Learning algorithm developed by OpenAI.
We use this algorithm to play the classic childhood game ,Super Mario Bros.
we can switch between different environment.The RL algorithm chooses the best combination from a given situation and executes it.
